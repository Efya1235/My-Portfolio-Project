This a dog web app portfolio created by me, bernice Afi Kumah and motivated by alx SE.
I chose dog because of how valuable loyalty in friendship is to me and majority will agree that we best find unarguable loyalty and companionship in puppies/dogs.
This project required a team but i ended up doing it alone relying om soley frontend thius html,css and javascript
Its a win to be able to put your minds into reality thanks to alx.
The challenge for this was trying to chnage the deployment name after using github and also applying a working api to my web app to make a list of dog breeds which also tells of wthe nature of the dog and the food it prefers
